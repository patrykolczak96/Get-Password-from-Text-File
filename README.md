# Get Password from User
Mini project but really helped me, quickly get password for a given user from text file with structure:
<br>
<code>
username1 - password
</code> <br>
<code>
username2 - password
 </code> <br>
 <code>...</code> <br>
 
call in terminal function from python script:
<code>
your_path\python users.py username
</code>

and thankful with module pyperclip you have password in clipboard
